**Lily, Tom, and the Truthful Treetop**

It was a crisp autumn morning in the magic forest. Lily and Tom were collecting colorful leaves to press into their scrapbook. Felix, the clever fox, trotted up to them, his fur shining like a warm fire in the sunlight.

“Hello, Felix!” Lily said. “What brings you here today?”

Felix tilted his head and looked worried. “I’ve just heard that Hugo the Hedgehog is feeling very sad. He’s hiding in the Treetop Grove and refuses to talk to anyone. The other animals don’t know how to help him.”

Tom furrowed his brow. “Why is Hugo sad? Did something happen?”

Felix shrugged. “We don’t know. But maybe you two can find out. Hugo trusts you.”

Lily and Tom nodded. With Tom’s never-lost compass pointing the way, they ventured to the Treetop Grove. The grove was beautiful, with tall, golden trees whose leaves shimmered like coins in the sunlight. But at the base of one tree, they spotted a little hedgehog curled into a tight ball.

“Hugo?” Lily called softly. “It’s us—Lily and Tom. Can we sit with you?”

Hugo peeked out, his little face filled with worry. “You’ll just laugh at me,” he muttered.

Tom sat down beside him. “We would never laugh at you, Hugo. You can tell us what’s wrong.”

Hugo hesitated. “I… I messed up,” he admitted quietly. “I was playing a game with the rabbits, and I accidentally tore their new leaf hammock. They didn’t see me do it, and I was too scared to tell them. Now I feel awful.”

Lily put a gentle hand on Hugo’s shoulder. “Oh, Hugo, it’s brave of you to tell us. But maybe you should tell the rabbits how you feel. They’ll understand.”

Tom added, “When I accidentally broke Lily’s favorite seashell last year, I felt scared too. But when I told her, it felt so much better. She forgave me, and we fixed it together.”

Hugo looked at them doubtfully. “But… what if they get mad?”

“They might,” Lily said honestly. “But being honest shows you care about them and want to make things right. That matters more than avoiding a hard conversation.”

After a long pause, Hugo took a deep breath. “Okay. Will you come with me?”

“Of course!” said Lily and Tom together.

They walked to the rabbits’ burrow, where the rabbits were busy repairing their hammock. Hugo shuffled nervously but finally said, “I have something to tell you. I… I accidentally tore your hammock earlier. I didn’t mean to, and I’m really sorry.”

The rabbits paused and looked at Hugo. Then, the biggest rabbit hopped forward with a small smile. “Thank you for telling us, Hugo. We’re not mad. Accidents happen, but it’s kind of you to admit it.”

Another rabbit added, “Why don’t we fix it together? It’ll be fun!”

Hugo’s face lit up with relief and gratitude. “I’d like that!”

As they worked together to mend the hammock, Hugo’s sadness melted away. Lily and Tom watched happily, knowing that Hugo had learned an important lesson about honesty and sharing how he felt.

That evening, as they returned home, Felix wagged his tail. “You two have a way of bringing out the best in everyone,” he said.

Tom grinned. “I think it’s because telling the truth feels good, even when it’s hard.”

“Especially when it’s hard,” Lily agreed.

And with that, they headed back to their cozy home, ready for their next adventure.
